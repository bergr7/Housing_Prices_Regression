## Project Motivation

I was curious to see how well regularised liner regression models work on the Boston Housing Prices dataset compare
to, a priori, more powerful models like Decision Trees.

## Results

I found out that with a bit of data preparation and feature engineering, ridge regression outperformed a Decision
tree regression with little data preparation, and I climbed some positions in the Kaggle leaderboard.
